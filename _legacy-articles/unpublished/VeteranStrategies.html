        <att>Veteran Strategies: <br />Advanced tips for getting the most out of the Eternal Power Calculator</att>

        <ats>
          Beyond the basics, a deeper understanding of <a href="" target="_blank">Eternal's</a> rules for draws, <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong> will give you a deck-building advantage
        </ats>

    <br />

    <atsub>
      A closer look at how starting order, <strong>mulligans</strong>, and <strong>Wild Cards</strong> can impact your <strong>Power</strong> base
	  </atsub>

    	<br />
      Import your deck into the <a href="../epc/" target="_blank">Eternal Power Calculator</a> for an instant snapshot of how your <strong>Power</strong> base will perform. Tinker by adding or removing cards from the list and you will immediately see the impact of these changes on the fly. <br />
	    <br />
      Once you have mastered these basic concepts, you will gain an even better understanding of your brews by considering the specific rules of <strong>Power</strong>, <strong>Influence</strong> and draws in <a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/" target="_blank">Eternal Card Game</a> and how they shape probabilities.

      <br /><br /><br />

			<ath>On the Play or On the Draw?</ath>
			<atsub style="color:#81C3F4;">Your odds of holding <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong> always increase<br /> when you go second</atsub>

			<!-- <img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/ReprobatesComposed.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;" title="Influence Chart" /> -->

          <br />

          The <a href="../epc/guide/index.html#draws" target="_blank">user’s guide</a> to the <a href="../epc/" target="_blank">Eternal Power Calculator</a> describes the value of thinking in terms of draws rather than turns. One of the most obvious applications of this concept occurs before you have even seen your first card. Are you going first or are you going second?
          <br /><br />
          The values in <strong>Column 1</strong> of the both the <strong>Influence Chart</strong> and the <strong>Power Odds Table</strong> represent your first turn if you are “on the play” (going first). Players “on the draw” (going second) receive an additional card draw as part of their opening hand.
          <br /><br />
          If you want a better indication of how your <strong>Power</strong> base will perform when going second, simply skip to <strong>Column 2</strong> and observe that your odds of holding <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong> increase. This is compensation for the disadvantage presented when your opponent takes a turn before you.
          <br /><br />
          You can use the same principle to account for extra draws from any effect in the game, including draw spells or things like <strong>Nightfall</strong> and <strong>Teacher of Humility's</strong> <strong>Infiltrate</strong> ability.
          <br /><br /><br />

			<img alt="Keep or Redraw?" src="images/VeteranStrategiesKoR.jpeg" style="margin-right: 900px; position: absolute; left: 110px; top: 1480px; float: left; width: 183px;" />

          <ath>Keep or Redraw? Eternal's mulligan rules</ath>
    			<atsub style="color:#81C3F4;">Your odds of holding <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong> increase when you redraw your opening hand <!-- (<em>nearly</em> always) --></atsub>
          <br />
          At the start of each game, both players are given an option to either keep or redraw the cards they have been dealt in what is commonly referred to as the “mulligan” phase.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Eternal’s</strong> mulligan rules ensure that you have an equal chance of holding two, three or four <strong>Power</strong> cards after redrawing. This mechanic was introduced <!-- by the game’s developers --> to mitigate <strong>Power</strong> shortages and floods.
          <br /><br />
          <!-- In order to be legal, at least one-third of the cards in your deck need to be Power cards. That means 25 Power cards in a typical 75 card constructed deck (or 15 in a 45 card limited deck). Many decks will have a few additional Power cards.-->
          <hr style="width: 600px; border: 1px solid #333333" />
          <p style="font: 14px Open Sans; color:#81C3F4; margin-top: 7px; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px;">
          <strong>Oversized Power base?</strong> Your deck probably does <em>not</em> include more than 32 Power cards (or more than 20 in a 45 card deck). If it does for some reason, consult the section on <a href="">Oversized Power bases</a>. Otherwise, read on.</p>
          <hr style="width: 600px; border: 1px solid #333333" />
          <br />
          It is important to note that your odds of holding <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong> in your opening hand will <em>not be lower</em> than what is displayed on the <strong>Eternal Power Calculator</strong>. However - after a redraw - your chances of drawing <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong> increase.
          <br /><br />
          There are a number of factors that determine how much of an increase occurs. (You can read more about them <a href="Mulligans.html" target="_blank">here</a>). But it helps to keep in mind that <em>the range of drawing your <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong> sources relative to each other remains unchanged.</em>
          <br /><br />
          In other words: if you have constructed your <strong>Power</strong> base to prioritize <img alt="Fire" src="../epc/icon-fire.png" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Time" /> on <strong>Turn 1</strong> or <img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-time.png" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Fire" /><img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-time.png" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Fire" /> on <strong>Turn 2</strong>, these priorities will remain proportionally consistent regardless of your mulligan choices.
          <br /><br />
          There are a lot of <a href="https://rngeternal.com/2017/11/09/drafters-corner-mulling-over-mulligans/" target="_blank">considerations</a> other than <strong>Power</strong> which contribute to a decision about whether or not to redraw your opening hand. But if you frequently mulligan, you may observe that your <strong>Power</strong> base performs slightly better than the snapshot displayed by the <strong>Eternal Power Calculator</strong>. Fortunately you can be confident that it will not perform any worse due to <strong>Eternal’s</strong> redraw rules.

          <br /><br /><br />

          <ath>Wild Cards</ath>
    			<atsub style="color:#81C3F4;">Your odds of holding <strong>Influence</strong> (but not <strong>Power</strong>) will sometimes  increase and sometimes decrease when using <strong>Wild Cards</strong></atsub>
          <br />
          A <a href="" target="_blank">handful</a> of <strong>Power</strong> sources in <strong>Eternal</strong> behave very differently from the rest by granting you an Influence of your choice. The Power Calculator treats these cards as Wild Cards.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Wild Cards</strong> factor in to the <strong>Influence</strong> probabilities, and are included in the overall <strong>Power</strong> source counts. However when you use a <strong>Wild Card</strong> to gain <strong>Influence</strong> in one faction, your total number of potential <strong>Influence</strong> sources in the other factions will be reduced.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Wild Cards</strong> are useful for certain strategies. But when using them, it helps to keep in mind that they slightly alter the probabilities represented by the <strong>Power Calculator</strong>.
          <br /><br />
          A useful technique for visualizing the impact of <strong>Wild Cards</strong> is to make a comparison between two nearly identical decks: In the first deck include your <strong>Wild Cards</strong>. In the second, replace the <strong>Wild Cards</strong> with a comparable card that does not grant <strong>Influence</strong>. (Some examples are provided <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>).
          <br /><br />
          This will give you a clear indication of the difference between the floor and the ceiling of how your <strong>Power</strong> base will perform with <strong>Wild Cards</strong>.

          <br /><br /><br />

          <ath>Final Thoughts</ath>
          <br />
          The immediate visualization displayed by the <strong>Eternal Power Calculator</strong> provides an overall representation of how your deck’s <strong>Power</strong> base will perform game after game. Understanding the subtleties of <strong>Eternal’s</strong> special rules and exceptions will maximize the value you can gain from it.
          <br /><br />
          The concepts introduced here are some of the more common in-game conditions and situations that may shape probabilities. If you have any questions, or would like to see a particular topic explored in a future article, please <a href="../contact/" target="_blank">get in touch</a>.
