  The landscape for **Eternal** looks a lot different now that it did for **Burning Hope** following the most recent \*[balance changes](https://steamcommunity.com/games/531640/announcements/detail/1690440309949401220). {% icon 'FJS' %} It remains to be seen what new archetypes will emerge - or what older ones may resurface - in response to the update. However it seems likely that **Winchest** midrange will continue to be part of the mix even as it may become less dominant.

**Fire** was featured in every one of the **Top Eight** decks from the competition, with **Winchest** {% icon 'FJS' %} composing more than half of lists in both the finals and the tournament overall. Yet each of the winners built their list somewhat differently.

All of the summaries here include a standout feature describing what sets each deck apart from the others. {.highlight}
