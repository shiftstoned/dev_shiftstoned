**{% date page.date %}** - With the conclusion of **The Price of Freedom** we are one step closer to the **2019 Eternal World Championship**, and two more players have earned an invitation to the main event. Congratulations to **GT100** and **Avyoine** for advancing to the next round, and to all those who qualified for the **ECQ**.

## The Top Eight

Underdog **Stonescar Scrappy Hour** prevailed in the end, while **Winchest Midrange** continued to be strongly represented in the **Top Eight** decks from the competition. Overall however, a much more diverse range of strategies were seen in the follow-up to [Burning Hope][].

<!-- <span style="color: #81C3F4">All of the summaries here include a standout feature describing what sets each deck apart from the others.</span> -->

<div class="pre-headline first">1st place:</div>

### [GT100's Deck][deck-1]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Stonescar Scrappy Hour)

  [deck-1]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBoMEBFEBICFtHEBlIEpfPEAjBEBdEE5GCBrIEBnMDDsHEDuBDB2JBBBIB5HEDsIEDBEA8BEBjNCAABBrIBEgHBrfPBDsHBF2F&t=GT100's%20Deck's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Price%20of%20Freedom%7D

{% card_image "Vara's Favor", "ci-small" %}

**Shadow** sources are heavily favored for **Witching Hour** (25{% icon 'SSSSSS' %}) as well as **Turn 4** **Market** cards **In Cold Blood** (4{% icon 'SS' %}) and **Burglarize** (4{% icon 'SS' %}). A full playset of **Granite Waystone** is an obvious choice for a **Grenadin**-focused strategy.

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} Without any **Justice Influence** sources, **Winchest Cargo** will never **Transmute** into **Wichest Contraband**. But unlike **Seek Power**, the 1-cost **Mult-faction Spell** may be swapped in and out of the **Market**. It can also allow **GT100** to potentially deceive unsuspecting opponents by masquerading as a **Winchest** deck early on.

<div class="pre-headline second">2nd place:</div>

### [Avyoine's Deck][deck-2]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Winchest Midrange)

  [deck-2]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EFtCEB4MEBIDFwGEpfPEFvHCFyGEFmGECsHEsfTEBsFDE2HCF2FEFkBDBBDB-DCB5HEDsIEEzHCDoIDA8BCA4BCA3BCAABrfBBsfCBF1GBEqEBFuD&t=Avyoine's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Price%20of%20Freedom%7D

{% card_image "Regent's Tomb", "ci-small" %}

An even distribution of **Fire**, **Justice** and **Shadow** sources waiting to be drawn by 4x **Seek Power**. Additional ramp comes in the shape of 3x **Lost Scroll** (2{% icon 'JS' %}). Meanwhile, the **Lingering Influence** (2{% icon 'J' %}) of the late **Rolant** surrounds **Regent's Tomb** (4 {% icon 'JS' %}). That extra **Power** draw helps **Avyoine** get to the late game quicker, as does the cost reduction to cards mined from **Quarry** (2 {% icon 'FS' %}).

**Standout features:**{.highlight} One of two nearly identical **Winchest** decks in the **Top 8**, the second-place finisher opts for **End of the Story** (6 {% icon 'JJ' %}), an additional sweeper in the **Market**.

<div class="pre-headline third">3rd place:</div>

### [Stormblessed's Deck][deck-3]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Xenan Midrange)

  [deck-3]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=CB7HCBtIEEjCEB2PEAjBDEkCECvGEF9GEBjDDF4BEsfTEFkCCD3CEFgHCF2FFB5HGB_BEDzBEEqIEA9BCCpGCAABB6HBD_BBCsBBrfPBpfJ&t=Stormblessed's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Price%20of%20Freedom%7D

{% card_image "Crest of Mystery", "ci-small" %}

A fresh take on **Xenan Midrange**. **Time** sources are marginally prioritized over **Shadow** for an early **Teacher of Humility** (2 {% icon 'TT' %}), and also for **Worldbearer Behemoth** (5 {% icon 'TTT' %}) - the only triple **Influence** card in the list. Full sets of both **Vara's Favor** (2 {% icon 'S' %}) and **Amber Waystone** provide a bit of extra lifegain in addition to **Power** and **Influence**.

<!-- 20T/19S. 4x Amber Waystone. 4x Vara's Favor. -->

**Standout features:**{.highlight} A unique **Site**-heavy build that **Stormblessed** has been quietly winning with on ladder. Expect to see more of this novel variant in **Ranked** following their strong finish in the Qualifier.

### [JuliusNovachrono's Deck][deck-4]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Jennev Peaks)

  [deck-4]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBhGEB4MEBIErfVEDlFEF0HEFsGEF3GEBjDEBjHCFkCEC3FEFkBEBBCB7FDB_BEDqIED7HEDlIBA1BCA2BBA_BCAABC8FBEjFBF7GBF1HBCrF&t=JuliusNovachrono's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Price%20of%20Freedom%7D

{% card_image "Display of Instinct", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 19F/18T/16P. -->

**Jennev Peaks** seemed poised to be the favorite leading up to the event, but in the end the archetype earned only one spot in the Top 8. **JuliusNovachrono's** build includes every **Crest** available to the {% icon 'Fire' %}{% icon 'Time' %}{% icon 'Primal' %} **Alliance**, as well as a full set of **Seek Power** to help meet the demanding **Influence** requirements.

**Standout features:**{.highlight} **Praxis Banner** in the **Black Market** sets up a timely **Torch** (1{% icon 'F' %}) or **Permafrost**(1{% icon 'P' %}) combo when paired with any of the deck's eight **Smugglers**.

### [camat0's Deck][deck-5]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Winchest Midrange)

  [deck-5]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=CFtCEB4MEBIDFtHCBtIEpfPEBvEDFvHEFyGEFmGDBjMEsfTEE2HEFkBCBBFB-DDB5HEDsIEEzHEDoICA8BCA3BCAABF1GBFaBB9JBBsFBFuD&t=camat0's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Price%20of%20Freedom%7D

{% card_image "Winchest Contraband", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 19F/22J/22S. -->

The [Eternal Tournament Series][] 2017 World Champion makes his **ECQ** debut with this list, falling just short of the finals for the event. Several characteristics help to distinguish [camat0's][] build from the other two **Winchest** decks found in the **Top Eight**. Every available **Crest** is included, and 3x **Winchest Cargo** are favored over **Lost Scroll** (2{% icon 'JS' %}). The absence of **Cauldron Cookbook** (2{% icon 'FF' %}) allows **camat0** to go a little lighter on **Fire** sources.

  [camat0's]: https://twitter.com/camat0_

**Standout features:**{.highlight} **Slay** (3{% icon 'JS' %}) is notably replaced by less costly removal spells **Annihilate** (2{% icon 'J' %}) and **Vanquish** (2{% icon 'J' %}). This likely helps to enable more efficient cudgel-making while one of the deck's three **Statuary Maiden** (4{% icon 'FS' %}) is in play.

### [isomorphic's Deck][deck-6]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (JPS Reanimator)

  [deck-6]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EB7HEEoGEBkGEF4DEBmIEDlFEE5GCDtFEB9EDBkJEBhMEsfVEBzJFB-DCB5HEEvIEDrIEBpNDBhNEA-BCAABBtIBElIBEgHBBkJBBhN&t=isomorphic's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Price%20of%20Freedom%7D

{% card_image "Chairman's Contract", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 17J/15P/17S. -->

A deck that breaks a lot of rules when it comes to constructing a **Power** base: **Azindel, Revealed** (8{% icon 'TTSS' %}) in a list that lacks any natural **Time** sources? **Privilege of Rank** (3{% icon 'J' %}) without any other **Justice Spells** or **Units**? Upon closer inspection, it all makes sense. Although **isomorphic** could technically gain {% icon 'TT' %} from a back-to-back pair of early **Diplomatic Seals**, the real strategy here is to reanimate **Azindel, Revealed** with **Grasping at Shadows** (5{% icon 'SS' %}) or **Vara, Fate-touched** (8{% icon 'SSS' %}). **Privilege of Rank** is included solely as a **Power** source, without regard to **Influence**. When combined with the plethora of discard effects, the **Justice** spell ensures that **Power** will nearly always be in hand - even if it is off-color.

**Standout features:**{.highlight} Rarely seen until recently, the self-milling **Fall of Argenport Power** card **Chairman's Contract** has risen in popularity with the demand for discard effects created by the [recent buff][] to **Vara, Fate-Touched**.

### [Thalian's Deck][deck-7]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Skycrag Yeti Aggro)

  [deck-7]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBNEBhGECpDEBIEC7FEE5EEDhFCqfBEEiIEF3GErfSEB_PEF5GDBBHB7FED3IBDBEA1BCEBEC6FCAABBoGBEjFBEhBBCiGBBwB&t=Thalian's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Price%20of%20Freedom%7D

{% card_image "Common Cause", "ci-small" %}

No less than 30 **Yetis** are jammed into this **Tribal** variation on **Skycrag Aggro**. **Primal** is given slight priority over **Fire**, most likely to reliably play **Wump, Party Starter** (3{% icon 'PP' %}) on time. Two of **Shugo Standard** and a single **Granite Waystone** provide **Thalian** with some extra aggression in a main deck that tops out at **4 Power**.

**Standout features:**{.highlight} With more **Yeti** per square inch than a **Snowfort**, the tribal **Power** source **Common Cause** does a better job here than **Diplomatic Seal**. **Thalian** is almost always likely to have more than one **Yeti** in hand, enabling **Common Cause** to deliver both **un-Depleted Power** and the required **Influence** at any stage of the game.

### [Stooglefish's Deck][deck-8]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Winchest Midrange)

  [deck-8]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EFtCEB4MEBIDFwGEpfPEFvHCFyGEFmGECsHEsfTEBsFDE2HCF2FEFkBDBBDB-DCB5HEDsIEEzHCDoIDA8BCA4BCA3BCAABFsCBrfBBsfCBF1GBFuD&t=Stooglefish's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Price%20of%20Freedom%7D

{% card_image "Lost Scroll", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 20F/20J/20S. -->

Identical to **Avyoine's** deck apart from one difference in the **Black Market**.

<!-- Four Winchest Cargos but no Lost Scrolls. Curve tops out at 7 for Xo and no Martyr's Cross. -->

**Standout features:**{.highlight} **Stooglefish** has opted to stock their eight **Smugglers** with an **Adjuicator's Gavel**, helping to defend against **Reanimator** strageties which have soared in popularity since the recent buff to **Vara, Fate-Touched**.
