## Market Forces

In addition, the calculator now features full support for modifying your **Markets** on the fly. You can add or remove cards in the **Market** and dynamically view changes to both the **Influence Chart** and **Power Odds Table**.

![Market section](/images/articles/Market520.jpeg "Market section")
{.main-col-image}

Any edits you make will automatically be included when you choose to share or export the decklist. (Note that **Power** sources in your **Market** intentionally do not count towards your overall **Power** and **Influence** totals).

We [welcome][contact] any feedback on these new features, along with any suggestions for future features or updates.

As **Eternal Card Game** enters a new era of full release, more fan-built features and enhancements for **Shiftstoned** are in the planning stages.

Huge thanks to the talents of Apostatic and Alex Middeleer. Without their tremendous efforts, it would not have been possible to bring these new features to life.
