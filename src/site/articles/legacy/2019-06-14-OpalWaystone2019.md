**{% date page.date %}** - **Shiftstoned** and **Eternal Warcry** have teamed up with the [Eternal Community League][] and **Kaelari's** [EternalTournaments.com][] to bring you the **Opal Waystone Classic**.

## A deck-building challenge

Four or more factions
{.tagline}

The **Opal Waystone** gets its **Power** from many different colors. In order to qualify for participation, registered decks must contain a minimum of eight cards in at least four factions ({% icon 'FTJPS' %}).

Multi-faction cards count toward the minimum requirements for each of their colors, but cards in the **Market** do not. The deck-building requirements will be automatically verified as part of the registration process.

RULES UPDATE: Based on feedback from the **Eternal** community, **Cargoes** no longer count toward the minimum requirements.
{style="color:#f8de7e;"}

For inspiration, we have profiled four and five faction lists from some of **Eternal's** best deckbuilders in the [Opal Waystone Brew Sampler][].
