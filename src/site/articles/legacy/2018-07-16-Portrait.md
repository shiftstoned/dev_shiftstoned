# Portrait of the Eternal power base as first-place *Saturday Challenge* finisher {.title}

Nishava took first place at the inaugural [Kaelari's Saturday Challenge][] event with an aggressive Combrei list entitled *[Rakano's weapons are outmatched!][]*

One of the first things you might notice is that Nishava has included
a lot of extra sources to help ensure that they will draw enough **Power**
and **Influence** to play their early units on **Turns 1**,
**2** and **3**.

For many decks, "extra power" means including an additional power card
beyond the minimum of 25. But here Nishava has included no fewer than
28.

A full playset of *Initiate of the Sands* brings the total
number of **Power** sources in the deck to 32.

## Time Quickens

{% card_image "Initiate of the Sands" %}

The **Influence Chart** tells us that the pilot of
this deck has a 91% chance of holding {% icon 'Time' %} in
their opening hand when going first, enough **Influence** to play *Initiate of
the Sands* on **Turn 1**.

This conveniently sets the table for playing one of the deck's twelve powerful 3-drops: *Kosul Battlemage*, *Unseen Commando*, and *Valkyrie Enforcer* each have an influence cost of {% icon 'JJ' %}.

We can see that even at this early stage, the odds of drawing {% icon 'JJ' %} are quite good: 77% after two draws. After three draws the chances are even better - up to 83%.

If Nishava is fortunate enough to draw undepleted power in the form of *Seat of Progress* it means that these units can be played as early as **Turn 2.**

And by surviving for at least one turn, *Intiate* enables even more powerful follow-up plays in the form of *Vanquisher's Blade* and *Copperhall Elite*.

## Mind Over Body

A 3-drop on **Turn 2** makes for a strong start, but what if *Initiate of the Sands* or *Seat of Progress* don't show up within the first couple of draws?

Nishava still has plenty of options even without them.

*Crownwatch Paladin* ({% icon 'J' %}) or *Awakened Student* ({% icon 'TJ' %}) on **Turn 2** are just as likely to frustrate your opponent, if not more so.

The chart shows us that the odds of drawing enough **Influence** to play either of these units on curve are in Nishava's favor:

{.main-col-image}

Note that the chances of playing *Crownwatch Paladin* are slightly better than for *Awakened Student*, and the **Power Odds Table** tells us why.

To play *Awakened Student* you need to draw at least two **Power** and also two different **Influence** sources: both {% icon 'Justice' %} and {% icon 'Justice' %}. For Nishava's first-place build, the combined odds of meeting each of these requirements after two draws are a healthy 87%.

![Power Odds](/images/articles/OutmatchedPowerOdds.jpeg "Outmatched power odds")
{.main-col-image}

Although *Crownwatch Paladin* requires the same amount of **Power** as *Awakened Student* - her **Influence** cost is less demanding, at a single {% icon 'Justice' %}. By consulting the table again we learn that the combined odds drawing enough **Power** *and* **Influence** to play *Crownwatch Paladin* after two draws are an even more comfortable 91%.

## Teacher of Humility

{% card_image "Teacher of Humility" %}

An aggressive deck like this one needs to be dropping units right out of the gate, and for the most part Nishava has a very good chance of doing just that on **Turns 1**, **2** and **3**.

The exception is *Teacher of Humility*, a powerful 2-cost {% icon 'TT' %} unit that has made quite an impression in the early **Fall of Argenport** meta. Nishava has chosen to prioritize their {% icon 'JJ' %} units over *Teacher* by including **Time** and **Justice** sources at a ratio of 21 {% icon 'Time' %} to 23 {% icon 'Justice' %}.

The odds of drawing enough **Influence** to play *Teacher* on curve trail behind the other 1 and 2-cost units by as much as 22%.

Although this is a sizable gap, it makes sense because there are three times as many units requiring at least a single **Justice** influence.

*Teacher of Humility* is an especially valuable tool in matchups where your opponent relies on a lot of extra card draw. But she doesn't necessarily need to be played on **Turn 2** in order to be effective for this deck's aggressive strategy. In this case, it is more important to make sure you have the resources needed to take an early lead in controlling the board.

## Unmatched!

Nishava has constructed a very reliable, low-risk power base for *Rakano's weapons are outmatched!*, and this undoubtedly contributed to their success in **Kaelari's Saturday Challenge**.
