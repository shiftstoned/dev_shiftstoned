**{% date page.date %}** - A couple weeks ago, the *Empire of Glass* Draft Packs [were updated][1/8 Update]{target="_blank} with some new cards and weighting changes *(weighting affects the rate a card appears in draft&mdash;for example, cards with a weight of 5x are five times more likely to appear in Draft Packs than cards with a weight of 1x at the same rarity)*.

Our trusty Grenadin have processed the changes into this handy interactive gallery for you! The official list of current Draft Pack contents and Expedition-legal cards can always be found [on DWD's site][Card List]{target="_blank}.
