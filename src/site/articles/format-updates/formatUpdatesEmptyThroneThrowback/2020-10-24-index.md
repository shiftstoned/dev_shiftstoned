**{% date page.date %}** - The [*Eternal* Celebration](https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/eternal-celebration/) has started, and with comes the [*Empty Thone* throwback draft](https://twitter.com/EternalCardGame/status/1319023677527199746). Throughout the Celebration week, all four packs in Draft will be the from the game's first set.

Other than one weekend's [throwback event back in 2018](https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/new-event-the-empty-throne-draft/), this will be the first time we've seen the *Empty Throne* draft format since *Omens of the Past* came out in July 2017.

This article only lists the cards in *The Empty Throne* packs that have changed since *Omens* came out. This isn't a guide to the format&mdash;though if you can find old guides this could make a nice companion tool. But for anyone who has played the format before and would like to know what has changed, and for anyone else who is just curious about what these cards used to be, I hope this is useful.

A few notes:
* This changelist is based on the [JSON data provided by EternalWarcry.com](https://eternalwarcry.com/cards/download).
* These are strictly cards that appear *in packs*&mdash;no *Set 0* cards or Promos are included.
* Cards with only non-functional, text-templating changes (such as reordered battle skills ) have been skipped.
* The remaining cards have been separated into *Relevant Changes* for cards with changes which may impact gameplay (such as stat changes), then *Other Changes* for functional changes that shouldn't affect games in this draft format (such as updated unit types).
