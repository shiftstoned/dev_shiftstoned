**{% date page.date %}** - The upcoming [Opal Waystone Classic][] will feature a unique deck-building challenge for competitors: registered decks must include eight or more cards from at least four different **Factions**.

  [Opal Waystone Classic]: /articles/OpalWaystone.html

[Defiance][] introduced a number of new multi-faction tools to [Eternal Card Game][]. Three-**Faction** decks have since become the norm for both **Ranked** mode and most tournament settings. At the same time&mdash;while a few innovators have begun to make forays&mdash;lists with our or more **Factions** have remained relatively unexplored territory.

To help provide inspiration to players leading up the event, we are featuring here a representative sample of 4+ faction lists from some of **Eternal’s** most well-known deck builders. Additional lists will be featured in the weeks to come, so if you have a brew to share please [get in touch][contact].

&ldquo;I’ve always enjoyed pushing the limitations on **Power** bases and the decks they can support and I feel this deck does just that. It may seem absurd to play a deck that requires a total of eleven **Influence** to operate at full effectiveness late game, but this deck is highly capable of reaching that threshold.<!-- There are many things I love about this deck and deck building choices that I should really do a full deck tech. PM me on discord if you think so too haha. -->&rdquo; - **Batteriez**

&ldquo;I thought this deck was going to be a meme when I built it, but \[then\] I went 11-7 at around 500 in **Masters**. **Savior of the Meek** gives you a decent chance against **Aggro**. The general gameplan is to shuffle **Nictotraxian** and your other **Fate** cards in and out of the market with **Merchants** to get a lot of **Fate** triggers.&rdquo; - **nothership**

&ldquo;Inspired by [The Herald Engine][] \[by **Aegis**\]. This deck is an absolute blast to play. If you already have the cards necessary then you should absolutely try it out.&rdquo; - **ThePlaytupusKing**

&ldquo;I reached masters with this deck in **Chapter 26** and took it to the **Burning Hope ECQ**. Basically I wanted to grab **FJS** and crowbar \[**Heart of the Vault**\] the most busted **Time** unit into it. **Sword of Unity** out of the market was ideally the trump card to break open the **FJS** mirror which was a common occurrence.&rdquo; - **y0ttabyte**

&ldquo;**Display of Power** is a five faction deck that tries to take advantage of every **Display**, utilizing at least two of each of their modes in the deck. It can be a powerful control deck when the factions line up well.&rdquo; - **Grimfan**

&ldquo;Ever wonder what would happen if you could play **FJS** with **Alessi**? No? Me neither. But that's okay because when encouraged to play **4F**, the rules change. Although an exceptionally greedy list, we get the best of both worlds between **Alessi** and **FJS** and create a monstrosity of powerful cards. Consistency may be a problem, but I can't see any decks out-valuing **FJS Alessi** making it a strong choice for this event.&rdquo; - **NotoriousGHP**

&ldquo;I assembled [this deck] not to see if it'd be good, but because I could. I just wanted some way to ramp to **Aid of the Hooru**. And at the time (Set 3), **Mask of Torment** was the only way to do that. It may still be the best way to do that, in all actuality.&rdquo; - **IlyaK**

&ldquo;A powerful linear aggro deck relying on its tribal synergies to overpower its opponents. I dont think I would change anything \[after Set 4\] - the deck is pretty linear and didn't get anything [new].&rdquo; - **ManuS**
