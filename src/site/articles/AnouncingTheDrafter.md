  <strong>November 3, 2020 UPDATE</strong> - <strong>The Drafter</strong> is now live for your picking pleasure <a href="/drafter">here</a> ! If you need help getting started, check out our handy <a href="/drafter/about/">user's guide.</a> And please help us to improve <strong>the Drafter</strong> by providing <a href="https://twitter.com/shiftstoned">your feedback</a>.

  We are pleased to announce a new tool joining the fan-built player resources at ShiftStoned at the end of this week’s celebration!

  Featuring evaluations by <strong>Jedi_EJ</strong> & his <strong>Eternal Journey Podcast</strong> co-hosts <strong>Johnholio</strong> and <strong>darth_herman2</strong>, <a href="https://www.shiftstoned.com/drafter/" target="_blank">the Drafter</a> will be your card selection companion when picking and brewing for <a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/" target="_blank">Eternal Card Game</a> draft runs. It is easily the next best thing to drafting directly with these talented players themselves!

  Coding wizardry for <strong>the Drafter</strong> was generously contributed by <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredmellentine" target="_blank">mlntn</a> of <a href="https://themisplay.com/" target="_blank">Team Misplay</a>, with indispensable organizational support provided by freaky <a href="https://eternalcardgame.fandom.com/wiki/Eternal_Card_Game_Wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> champion <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PusillanimousGamer/" target="_blank">PusillanimousGamer</a>.

  This is new territory for all of us, and bound to be a bit experimental. We are looking forward to the community’s response when <strong>the Drafter</strong> goes live at the end of the celebration and the regular Draft format returns.
